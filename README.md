# Fintech_Module_5_Challenge


## Software Requirements


## Description:

    This project aims to provide two separate financial analysis tools within one jupyter notebook. 

    The first tool for financial analysis is a financial planner for emergencies. Users are able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then allow the program to determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund via conditional logic. 
    
    The second tool for financial anlysis is a financial planner for retirement. This tool forecasts the performance of a user's retirement portfolio over two time periods: 30 years and 10 years. In order to do this, the tool makes an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations that are integrated into the jupyter notebook program.
